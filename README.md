The code situated within this repository is based on matching objects with one another. It is
basically a game that allows one to sort colourful water until each glass or container consists
of a single color. The code solves equivalent objects and can be modified to not just work with colors
but any form where a match is required. The approach to this game is based on data structures using 
stacks. The entry point is also the exit point where a LIFO(Last in, first out) approach is used
for the objects to be macthed which in this case is colorful water. It serves as a challenge to the mind.
